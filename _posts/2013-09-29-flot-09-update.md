title: Flot 0.9 update

Work on Flot 0.9 has been proceeding slowly but steadily.  We've continued to
clean up the codebase, and have been merging 'on green' (in terms of style)
for several months now.

Thanks to work by [Nick Schonning](https://github.com/nschonni) we now build
using Grunt instead of Make.  This does add a dependency on node.js, which we
previously used only for JSHint, but it gives us flexibility to add things
like automatic inlining of third-party dependencies.

Rotated text has been working in the 0.9-work branch for some time now; for
example, here's what the multi-axis example looks like with y-axis labels:

```js
yaxes: [{
   label: "Price (USD)"
}, {
   alignTicksWithAxis: 1,
   position: "right",
   label: "USD/EUR exchange rate",
   labelPadding: 7
}]
```

</div>

Rotated tick labels still aren't quite ready yet, but will be soon. The final
step is to make this available to plugins, so instead of implementing custom
HTML or canvas text you'll be able to use a simple API from within hooks. The
result will automatically render to either HTML or canvas, with styles, and
looks almost pixel-identical, even when rotated, on browsers back to IE7.
