We're excited to announce the release of Flot 0.8!  Two years in the making, it
includes more than a hundred new features and bug fixes from more than fifty
contributors.  [Download](http://www.flotcharts.org/downloads/flot-0.8.0.zip)
the new version and enjoy!

### What's New in 0.8? ###

**Time series improvements:** Support for time series has been moved into a
plugin, jquery.flot.time.js, and a new axis option "timezone" controls the
time zone in which dates are displayed.

**Canvas text**: A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, renders axis tick labels
directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements, making it much easier
to save entire plots as images.

**Plotting categories**: The new categories plugin makes it easy to plot data
that is grouped into text categories rather than numeric axis values.

**Plotting error bars**: The new error bars plugin can be used to show standard
deviation and other useful statistical properties.

**Support for high-resolution displays**: Flot now looks even crisper on the
high-density displays found in many new phones, tablets, and laptops.

**Lots of bug fixes**: We've fixed over a hundred bugs, resolving long-standing
issues with the pie plugin and cross-browser compatibility, among many others.

**Many other enhancements**: We've added everything from improved control over
the grid's appearance to legend sorting to thresholding improvements.

See the [NEWS file](https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/0.8.0/NEWS.md) for a
complete listing of changes made and bugs fixed.
