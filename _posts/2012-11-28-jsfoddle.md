Development of 0.8 is progressing well; we stand at more than 50% complete,
with [29 issues remaining](https://github.com/flot/flot/issues?milestone=1).

We're taking a break to share a cool new tool written by Stig Rune called
[Foddle](http://foddle.xdevelopers.net). It takes the concepts behind the
popular [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) and applies them to Flot, providing
an easy and powerful way to prototype charts with real-time feedback!

The app presents two fields: one for data and one for plot options. Keep in
mind that the data and options must be in JSON format, not raw JavaScript, and
the data should consist of a list of series objects; simple lists of values
aren't yet supported, though they may be in a future iteration.

Here's a [quick example](http://foddle.xdevelopers.net/?#864c55a7ac5ec473d031be7f0fb30d4a)
showing the sales distribution for the five best-selling Girl Scout Cookie
varieties.

Foddle really makes it easy to create and share charts on the web; it's a great
idea, and there's still room for it to grow even better.
