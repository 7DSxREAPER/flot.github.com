Flot has never had a logo, and as classy as Github's [Octocat](http://octodex.github.com)
silhouette profile picture may be, we felt that it was time for something a
little more unique.  If you've visited our site recently then you've already
seen it, hiding inside the title at the top-left corner of the page.  Here's a
larger version:

<div class="blog-image">
	<img src="/images/blog/2013-01-28-flots-new-logo.png" alt="{{ post.title }}" title="{{ post.title }}" width="400" height="400"></img>
</div>

The design features a simple, colorful, recognizable shape that evokes a pie
chart and integrates with the text of Flot's name.  We hope you like it!

We've also been busy finalizing the 0.8.0 release; the last major work-item,
finalizing canvas text support, is now available in draft form as pull request
[#935](https://github.com/flot/flot/pull/935).  Since this is a major change,
we'd greatly appreciate feedback on our design and direction; please add any
comments directly to the pull request.  We'll enter beta as soon as this is
merged.

Last, but not least, we've just pushed a re-design of the built-in examples.
All the pages have received minor face-lifts, with a larger placeholder,
cleaner text, and the version of Flot used to render the example (addressing
issue [#626](https://github.com/flot/flot/issues/626)).  We have many more
example and documentation improvements planned for 0.9.0.
