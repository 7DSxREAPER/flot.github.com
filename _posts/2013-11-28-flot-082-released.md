We've released Flot 0.8.2, with patches for many new and long-standing bugs,
including the remaining regressions introduced in 0.8.  You can
[download 0.8.2 here](http://www.flotcharts.org/downloads/flot-0.8.2.zip).

### Important Bug Fixes in 0.8.2 ###

**Tick Labels**: Fixed several issues related to axis ticks, including bugs
in the way widths were assigned to narrowly-spaced labels, and a change that
broke the [flot-tickrotor](http://github.com/markrcote/flot-tickrotor) plugin.

**Resize plugin**: Updated the inline jQuery Resize plugin to the latest
version, fixing several errors and a possible memory leak.

**Rendering Glitches**: Fixed a variety of rendering bugs, including white
circles drawn over pie plots, bars not being filled-in on some browsers, and
incorrectly-placed highlights when using right-aligned bars.

See the [NEWS file](https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/0.8.2/NEWS.md) for a
complete listing of changes made and bugs fixed.
